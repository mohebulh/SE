    <p id="paragraph">Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript, sometimes shortened to JS, 
        is a computer language and a fundamental component of the World Wide Web. By 
        2024, client-side JavaScript will be used by 98.9% of websites to control 
        webpage behaviour, frequently integrating third-party libraries [10]. A 
        specific JavaScript engine is built into every major web browser to run the 
        code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is an ECMAScript-compliant high-level language that is frequently 
        compiled just in time.[11] It has first-class functions, prototype-based 
        object-orientation, and dynamic typing. It supports imperative, functional, 
        and event-driven programming paradigms and is multi-paradigm. It can operate 
        with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the 
        Document Object Model (DOM) thanks to its application programming interfaces 
        (APIs).
